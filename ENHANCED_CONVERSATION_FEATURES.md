## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Multi-turn Business Analysis
```
User: "What are the latest business developments in verichains?"
Bot: [Comprehensive analysis with context about verichains developments]

User: "Any new customers mentioned?"
Bot: [Builds on previous context, focuses on customer information from the same domain]

User: "Can you analyze the trends in these developments?"
Bot: [Provides sophisticated trend analysis connecting all previous information]
```

### Context Switching and Return
```
User: "What's happening with cryptocurrency markets?"
Bot: [Switches context to crypto markets]

User: "Going back to verichains, what were the key partnerships?"
Bot: [Intelligently returns to previous context, recalls partnership information]
```

- **Intelligent content summarization** when approaching limits

### Rich Metadata Tracking
```python
# Example of rich message metadata
{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "What are the latest developments?",
    "query_type": "search",
    "topics_discussed": ["business", "developments"],
    "entities_mentioned": ["verichains"],
    "time_period_referenced": "recent",
    "search_results_count": 15
}
```

### Conversation Analysis Output
```python
{
    "conversation_themes": ["business_analysis", "market_trends"],
    "user_intent_patterns": ["seeks_detailed_analysis", "prefers_comprehensive_responses"],
    "topic_evolution": "Started with general business inquiry, evolved to specific trend analysis",
    "next_likely_questions": ["What about financial performance?", "How do these compare to competitors?"],
    "information_preferences": {
        "detail_level": "detailed",
        "prefers_analysis": true,
        "prefers_summaries": false
    }
}
```
