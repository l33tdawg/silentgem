## Chat Insights Feature (v1.2)

SilentGem includes a powerful Chat Insight feature that allows you to query your conversation history in your translated channels:

### Overview

Chat Insights automatically stores all translated messages in a local database and provides a natural language interface to search and analyze your conversation history through a dedicated Telegram bot.

#### NEW: Cross-Chat Contextual Analysis

The latest version includes enhanced contextual analysis capabilities:
- **Cross-chat awareness**: Search and analyze information across all monitored channels
- **Larger context window**: Get more context around matched messages (15 messages before/after)
- **Unified insights**: See connections between information from different sources
- **Smart context organization**: Messages are grouped by chat for better understanding

### Setting Up Chat Insights

Chat Insights is enabled by default. You can customize its settings with:

```bash
python silentgem.py --setup-insights
```

During setup, you'll create a dedicated Telegram bot (via BotFather) that will be automatically added to your target channels.

#### Creating a Bot with BotFather

To create a bot for Chat Insights:

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Start a chat with BotFather
3. Send the `/newbot` command
4. Follow the instructions to:
   - Set a name for your bot: We recommend using "SilentAsk" for consistency
   - Set a username for your bot: We recommend "silentask_bot" (or any name ending with "bot")
5. BotFather will give you a token (like `123456789:ABCDefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ`)
6. Copy this token when prompted during the `--setup-insights` process

The bot will be automatically added to your target channels during setup, or you can manually add it later.

### Using Chat Insights

There are two ways to query your conversation history:

#### 1. Using the /askgem Command

In any target channel where the bot is present:

```
/askgem Who talked about APIs yesterday?
```

#### 2. Directly Messaging the Bot

You can also directly message the bot with your query:

```
Who talked about APIs yesterday?
```

### Example Queries

Chat Insights understands natural language queries. Examples:

- "What was discussed today?"
- "Show messages from yesterday about the project"
- "Find all mentions of APIs from last week"
- "What did Alice say about the database?"
- "Show discussions about the UI redesign"
- "Summarize what different groups are saying about the Ukraine situation"
- "Compare discussions about the new feature across all channels"

You can ask these questions in any target channel where the bot is present or in a direct message to the bot. The bot will search across all your channels and provide clickable links to the original messages.

### Privacy and Security

Your messages are stored locally on your system. You can configure:

- **Message retention periods**: Control how long messages are stored
- **Anonymization**: Remove sender information
- **Content filtering**: Store only metadata instead of full content

To clear all stored message history:

```bash
python silentgem.py --clear-insights-history
```

For more detailed documentation on Chat Insights, see `docs/chat_insights.md`

## Roadmap

### Version 1.3 - Bidirectional Communication

The next version will enable seamless bidirectional communication:

- **Reply to Original Messages**: Send replies back to source chats with automatic translation
  - `/reply [message]` - Reply to the last message in original source chat
  - `/send [message]` - Send a new message to the original channel
- **Enhanced Search Capabilities**: Semantic search for concept-based queries
- **Conversation Summarization**: Get AI-generated summaries of past discussions
- **Secure & Private**: All features respect your privacy with user-owned data storage
