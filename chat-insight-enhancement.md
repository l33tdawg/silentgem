# Chat Insight Enhancement for SilentGem

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of SilentGem's Chat Insight feature that allows users to query conversation history in their private target channels. This feature is enabled by default and allows users to message a bot within the private channel to gain insights about past conversations, search for specific topics, or find out who discussed particular subjects.

## Implementation Status

### Completed Features
- ✅ Message storage database schema implemented
- ✅ Configuration system for Chat Insights (insights_config.py)
- ✅ Integration with translation flow to store messages
- ✅ Interactive setup wizard (insights_setup.py)
- ✅ User interface for configuring all aspects of Chat Insights
- ✅ Command-line arguments (--setup-insights, --clear-insights-history)
- ✅ Menu integration (option 8 in main menu)
- ✅ Support for storing media messages with metadata
- ✅ Privacy settings (anonymization, content filtering)
- ✅ Message retention policies

### Remaining Tasks
- ✅ Telegram Bot command handler for processing user queries
- ✅ Bot initialization at startup
- ✅ Query processing with LLM integration
- ✅ Advanced search capabilities
- ✅ Response formatting with different verbosity levels
- ✅ Testing and debugging the full query workflow
- ✅ Documentation for users

## Core Components

### 1. Message Storage System
- **Database Enhancement**: Extend the current database to store all translated messages automatically
- **Schema Design**: 
  - Message ID
  - Original message ID
  - Sender information
  - Timestamp
  - Source chat
  - Content (text, media captions)
  - Metadata (topics, entities, etc.)
  - Source language and target language

### 2. Telegram Bot Integration
- Automatically guide users through creating a dedicated bot (via BotFather) during setup
- Automatically add the bot to all private target channels
- Set up webhook or polling mechanism to receive commands
- Ensure all new target channels automatically get the bot added

### 3. Command Interface
- Simplified command structure leveraging LLM capabilities:
  - `/askgem [query]` - Single command for all informational queries 
  - Support for natural language queries without command prefix (e.g., "Who talked about the API yesterday?")

### 4. Query Processing Pipeline
- **Natural Language Understanding**: 
  - Use the same LLM engines (Gemini or Ollama) to parse queries
  - Extract entities, topics, and query intent from natural language input
  - Determine query type (status update, information search, person identification)
  - Handle complex, multi-part queries
- **Search and Retrieval**: 
  - Implement full-text search capabilities
  - Add semantic search for concept-based queries
  - Time-based filtering (today, yesterday, this week, etc.)

### 5. Response Generation
- Summarize findings using LLM
- Include relevant quotes from the conversation
- Provide links to original messages where possible
- Format responses for readability in Telegram

## Technical Implementation

### Database Extensions
- Add new tables for message storage
- Implement indexing for efficient searching
- Consider vector embeddings for semantic search capability
- Store language mapping for each chat pair

### API Integration
- Telegram Bot API for command handling
- Continue using the existing Telegram client for monitoring and translation
- Extend LLM usage for query understanding and response generation

### User Experience
- Simple, intuitive command syntax focused on actions
- LLM-powered natural language understanding for most queries
- Pagination for large result sets
- Inline buttons for refining searches

## Configuration and Defaults

### Default Behavior
- Feature enabled automatically during installation/upgrade
- Bot created and added to all target channels
- Unlimited message retention
- Same LLM used for querying as for translation
- Standard query processing depth
- Full message content stored
- Standard response verbosity with timestamps and sender info

### Customizable Settings (via --setup-insights)
- **Bot Setup**:
  - Bot token (created via BotFather)
  - Bot username and display name customization

- **Storage Settings**:
  - Message retention period (30 days, 90 days, 1 year, unlimited)
  - Storage location (local SQLite, custom path option)
  - Backup frequency (optional)

- **Query Processing**:
  - Use same LLM as translation (default: yes)
  - Alternative LLM selection if different from translation
  - Query processing depth (basic, standard, detailed) - affects token usage

- **Privacy Controls**:
  - Store message metadata only (vs. full content)
  - Anonymize sender information (optional)
  - Encryption for sensitive data
  - Auto-purge options (time-based)

- **Response Formatting**:
  - Verbosity level (concise, standard, detailed)
  - Include original message quotes (yes/no)
  - Include timestamps (yes/no)
  - Include sender information (yes/no)

## Privacy and Security Considerations
- Store only translated messages in the private channels
- Implement configurable message retention policies
- Consider encryption for sensitive data
- Bot is owned by the user and added to their private channels only

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (✅ COMPLETED)
- ✅ Set up message storage database
- ✅ Create automated bot setup process
- ✅ Implement message storage in translation flow
- ✅ Add bot to all target channels

### Phase 2: Query Processing (✅ COMPLETED)
- ✅ Implement command interface
- ✅ Develop natural language query processing
- ✅ Create search functionality
- ✅ Design response formatting

### Phase 3: User Experience (✅ COMPLETED)
- ✅ Finalize bot setup integration
- ✅ Set sensible defaults
- ✅ Allow optional customization
- ✅ Add automated bot addition for new channels

## Integration with Existing SilentGem Architecture
- ✅ Maintain compatibility with both translation engines (Gemini or Ollama)
- 🔄 Leverage existing LLM integration for enhanced query understanding
- ✅ Preserve existing chat mapping functionality
- 🔄 Ensure the bot works in parallel with the translation service
- ✅ Add new command-line options for managing insight features

## Command Line Options Added
- ✅ `--setup-insights`: Customize chat insight features
- ✅ `--clear-insights-history`: Clear stored message history

## Security Updates
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to prevent sensitive data from being committed
- ✅ Ensured database files and configurations remain private
- 🔄 Implementing secure storage for bot tokens
