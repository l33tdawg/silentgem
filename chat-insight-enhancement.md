## Core Components

### 1. Message Storage System
- **Database Enhancement**: Extend the current database to store all translated messages automatically
- **Schema Design**: 
  - Message ID
  - Original message ID
  - Sender information
  - Timestamp
  - Source chat
  - Content (text, media captions)
  - Metadata (topics, entities, etc.)
  - Source language and target language

### 2. Telegram Bot Integration
- Automatically guide users through creating a dedicated bot (via BotFather) during setup
- Automatically add the bot to all private target channels
- Set up webhook or polling mechanism to receive commands
- Ensure all new target channels automatically get the bot added

### 3. Command Interface
- Simplified command structure leveraging LLM capabilities:
  - `/askgem [query]` - Single command for all informational queries 
  - Support for natural language queries without command prefix (e.g., "Who talked about the API yesterday?")

### 4. Query Processing Pipeline
- **Natural Language Understanding**: 
  - Use the same LLM engines (Gemini or Ollama) to parse queries
  - Extract entities, topics, and query intent from natural language input
  - Determine query type (status update, information search, person identification)
  - Handle complex, multi-part queries
  - Improved understanding of conversational queries
  - Better pattern matching for common question types
- **Search and Retrieval**: 
  - Implement full-text search capabilities
  - Add semantic search for concept-based queries
  - Time-based filtering (today, yesterday, this week, etc.)
  - Context-aware retrieval with surrounding messages

### 5. Response Generation
- Synthesize information from multiple messages into coherent answers
- Generate conversational, natural-sounding responses
- Provide direct answers rather than just search results
- Include relevant quotes and details when appropriate
- Format responses for readability in Telegram
- Adapt tone and detail level based on query intent and verbosity setting

## Technical Implementation

### Database Extensions
- Add new tables for message storage
- Implement indexing for efficient searching
- Consider vector embeddings for semantic search capability
- Store language mapping for each chat pair

### API Integration
- Telegram Bot API for command handling
- Continue using the existing Telegram client for monitoring and translation
- Extend LLM usage for query understanding and response generation

### User Experience
- Conversational, ChatGPT-like interaction
- Natural language responses that directly answer queries
- Contextual understanding of follow-up questions
- Enhanced information synthesis across channels
- Status tracking for ongoing topics

## Configuration and Defaults

### Default Behavior
- Feature enabled automatically during installation/upgrade
- Bot created and added to all target channels
- Unlimited message retention
- Same LLM used for querying as for translation
- Standard query processing depth
- Full message content stored
- Standard response verbosity with timestamps and sender info

### Customizable Settings (via --setup-insights)
- **Bot Setup**:
  - Bot token (created via BotFather)
  - Bot username and display name customization

- **Storage Settings**:
  - Message retention period (30 days, 90 days, 1 year, unlimited)
  - Storage location (local SQLite, custom path option)
  - Backup frequency (optional)

- **Query Processing**:
  - Use same LLM as translation (default: yes)
  - Alternative LLM selection if different from translation
  - Query processing depth (basic, standard, detailed) - affects token usage
  - Conversation style (informational, conversational, analytical)

- **Privacy Controls**:
  - Store message metadata only (vs. full content)
  - Anonymize sender information (optional)
  - Encryption for sensitive data
  - Auto-purge options (time-based)

- **Response Formatting**:
  - Verbosity level (concise, standard, detailed)
  - Include original message quotes (yes/no)
  - Include timestamps (yes/no)
  - Include sender information (yes/no)

## Privacy and Security Considerations
- Store only translated messages in the private channels
- Implement configurable message retention policies
- Consider encryption for sensitive data
- Bot is owned by the user and added to their private channels only
